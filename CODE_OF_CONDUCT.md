# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We want FAIRy Lab to be a welcoming, inclusive project where people from many
backgrounds can collaborate and learn together.

As participants, maintainers, and contributors, we pledge to interact in ways
that foster a safe, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that helps create a positive environment include:

- Showing empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of different opinions, experiences, and viewpoints
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project
- Using welcoming and inclusive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Public or private insults, derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Using project spaces primarily for advertising, recruiting, or
  self-promotion unrelated to FAIRy without prior agreement from the
  maintainers
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Project chat spaces (if any)
- Community events related to FAIRy or FAIRy Lab

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in
public spaces.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of
Conduct. They may take appropriate and fair action in response to behavior
they consider unacceptable, including:

- Asking a participant to stop the behavior
- Removing or editing comments, code, or other contributions
- Temporarily or permanently banning a participant from project spaces

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or if
you have any other concerns, please contact the maintainers at:

**hello@datadabra.com**

Reports will be handled as promptly and privately as possible. We will respect
the wishes of reporters who request confidentiality.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open source community guidelines and
similar documents used across the open source ecosystem.
