name: "GEO RNA-seq (minimal)"
version: "v0"
about: "Starter list of fields commonly required for GEO RNA-seq submissions. This is an early draft profile, not full validation."

required:
  sample:
    - sample_id          # unique ID for each biological sample
    - organism           # e.g. Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana
    - tissue             # e.g. liver, leaf, root; or cell_line / cell_type
    - condition          # experimental condition / treatment label

  experiment:
    - library_strategy   # e.g. RNA-Seq
    - library_layout     # single-end / paired-end
    - instrument_model   # e.g. Illumina NovaSeq
    - read_length        # number of bases per read
    - strandedness       # stranded / unstranded

  run:
    - files[]            # at least one data file reference for each run

notes:
  - "Intended as an internal stub. FAIRy will turn this into an actual rulepack profile (e.g. --profile geo, --profile ena, --profile ncbi)."
  - "Real field-level validation (max length, allowed characters, etc.) is handled in schema.md and per-field rules."
  - "In future, this profile will export to repository-specific submission formats."
